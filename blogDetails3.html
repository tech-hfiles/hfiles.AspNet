                <h1>Cat Nutrition</h1>
                <h5>Published on: Aug 8, 2023 | Readtime: 2 min</h5>
                <div class="fakeimg_banner" style="height:300px;"></div>
                <p>
                    Cats are infamous for being picky eaters. Their pickiness could be attributed to a variety of
                    reasons, the
                    most common being that they are simply not stimulated enough or they require some variety in their
                    diet.
                    However, when they do choose to oblige us by eating, we are often left wondering whether we are
                    providing our feline companions with adequate nutrition or not.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Understanding the fundamental requirements of a cat&apos;s diet may help you resolve your concerns in
                    this
                    regard.
                </p>
                <h2>Taurine</h2>
                <p>
                    A discussion on feline nutrition is incomplete without the word &quot;taurine&quot;. Taurine is an amino acid
                    that is
                    considered an essential amino acid in cats. They require relatively large amounts of it in their
                    diet. Cats
                    can make some taurine, but the enzyme required to make it out of cysteine is in short supply and
                    needed
                    in other physiological pathways. Therefore, without an adequate dietary supply of taurine, cats
                    eventually
                    become taurine deficient.

                </p>
                <p>
                    A taurine deficiency can have severe ramifications. Taurine-depleted cats will have retinal
                    degeneration,
                    cardiomyopathy, altered white-cell function, and abnormal growth and development. A taurine
                    deficiency
                    can also lead to reproductive failure, poor growth in kittens born to taurine-deficient cats, and
                    gastrointestinal disturbances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Taurine is found almost exclusively in animal-based sources of protein (meat, fish, etc.) so cats
                    eating
                    vegetarian or vegan diets are at the highest risk.
                </p>
                <h2>What should cats eat?</h2>
                <p>
                    Cats are obligate carnivores. They need certain nutrients that their body cannot make unless it is
                    fed. This
                    is possible only by way of feeding them meat. As indicated above, animal-based sources of protein
                    (poultry dark meat, buffalo meat, pork tenderloin to name a few) contain the amino acid taurine and
                    several other nutrients that are essential to your cat&apos;s diet. Fresh lightly cooked meats or raw
                    diets, is
                    what we recommend for our feline companions, as the diet is rich in moisture and has all the
                    essential
                    components needed to keep our cats healthy.
                </p>
                <h2>Choosing cat food</h2>
                <p>
                    We are big proponents of feeding fresh – because fresh meats have nutrients that are more
                    bioavailable
                    to your cat without all the nasty preservatives, colouring and non-species-appropriate ingredients.
                    However, if you were to opt for processed food for the sake of convenience, we recommend opting for
                    wet
                    food as opposed to dry food. Since cats don&apos;t tend to drink too much water being desert animals, dry
                    food
                    could at some point lead to a higher risk of Feline Urinary Tract Disease and Kidney Disease. What&apos;s
                    worse is that kidney disease usually goes undetected until 70% of the kidney functionality has been
                    eroded – making it a little too late to salvage the situation.
                </p>
                <h2>Commercial cat food</h2>
                <p>
                    If you have opted for commercial cat food, do look at the list of ingredients. You must avoid foods
                    that
                    have colouring, preservatives, palatants and too many words you don&apos;t understand on the label.
                    Always
                    remember that ingredients are listed in order of percentage that the food is made up most of – that
                    means
                    that if you have corn or soy as one of the first few ingredients, it means that the food is in
                    essence carb
                    heavy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a general rule, you must ensure that the food you pick is low on carbs and low on fibre. Your cat
                    will
                    overeat carb-heavy food in a bid to make up for the lack of protein in the food. This will, in the
                    long run,
                    lead to obesity, diabetes, fatty liver disease, pancreatitis and a host of inflammatory conditions
                    that could
                    have been avoided if your cat was fed a species-appropriate diet.
