                <h1>Supplementing Dogs Diet</h1>
                <h5>Published on: Aug 8, 2023 | Readtime: 2 min</h5>
                <div class="fakeimg_banner" style="height:300px;"></div>
                <p>
                    There seems to be such a buzz about Supplements in the pet industry these days. Some are touted to
                    relieve achy
                    joints while some promise to make your pooch&apos;s coat shinier. Unfortunately, supplements cannot be
                    standardised. The key before adding anything to your pet&apos;s diet is to see what is already present in
                    the diet and
                    then supplement accordingly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Store-bought commercial pet food often requires no supplementation as it contains a synthetic
                    vitamin and
                    mineral mix. However, adding some species appropriate fresh foods to your pet&apos;s bowl like steamed
                    meat and
                    fish, eggs, steamed veggie and fruits can up the nutritional quotient of your pet&apos;s food. If you
                    have chosen to
                    feed freshly cooked meals to your pet, we recommend that you work with a <a href="#"> certified pet nutritionist</a>
                    or a vet to
                    ensure the meals are balanced and in the right proportion for your pet.
                </p>
                <h3>For a healthy dog, we have listed the following natural essential supplements*:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="#">Bone Meal</a> and <a
                            href="#">Egg Shell Powder</a> are a natural
                        source of calcium. Calcium is the most abundant
                        mineral found in
                        animals and dogs that are deficient in calcium can develop weak bones. Supplementing a home
                        cooked diet with
                        calcium is absolutely necessary. For an adult dog we suggest that you rotate between Bone Meal
                        and Egg Shell
                        Powder. For a puppy, only Bone Meal Powder should be incorporated. The recommend dosage is 1 tsp
                        per 500
                        grams of food fed.

                    <li>
                        Kelp and Seaweed, both found in supplements like <a href="#">Plaque Off by ProDen</a> and <a href="#">
                            Green Glory by Magic
                            Paws
                        </a>, are
                        excellent sources of Iodine. Iodine supports your dog&apos;s metabolism and helps them produce
                        thyroid hormones. When
                        iodine levels are too low, weight, energy, and mood imbalances are common. Unless one feeds the
                        thyroid glands of
                        prey to their dogs, feeding fresh may fall short of iodine. Please note that excess consumption
                        of iodine can suppress
                        the thyroid gland and cause complications, always ensure supplementation is happening in the
                        correct dose. Ideal
                        iodine requirements, as per NRC guidelines, are 220 mcg for a dog eating 1000 Kcal a day.

                        Omega 3 Fatty Acids are essential fatty acids known for its anti-inflammatory benefits. Sources
                        of Omega 3 can
                        be plant based, such as <a href="#">

                        </a>, or Fish Oil,
                        are also an
                        incredible source of Omega 3 Fatty Acids. EPA & DHA found in Omega-3 fatty acid, have been found
                        to aid in the
                        proper brain and eye development of puppies and also improve cognitive function in older dogs
                        dealing with canine
                        cognitive dysfunction. Adding some source of Omega 3 Fatty Acids into your pet&apos;s bowl can do
                        wonders!
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <a href="#">Cold Pressed Coconut Oil</a> is an
                        excellent source of Medium Chain Tryglicerides. This supplement
                        is not only
                        great for the skin and coat, but also has shown to be beneficial with cognitive recognition in
                        both young and senior
                        dogs and has helped reduce the incidence of seizures in epileptic dogs. We recommend 1 tsp of
                        coconut oil per 5 kgs
                        of body weight. You can start with ¼ of this amount and work up to the recommended dosage. If
                        your dog gets loose
                        motions from coconut oil, just cut back the dose.

                        The <a href="#"> Superfood Supplement</a> and <a href="#">Oil Supplement</a> by Nutriwoof are both
                        sources of Vitamin E – a
                        powerful
                        antioxidant. Adding them to your pet&apos;s meals is an easy way of supplementing your pet&apos;s diet
                        with small doses of
                        Vitamin E. This fat-soluble vitamin helps boost immunity, fight against free radical damage and
                        help prevent ageing and cancer. Natural sources of vitamin E include cold-pressed vegetable
                        oils, nuts, seeds, green leafy vegetables,
                        eggs, and most fish and meats like beef, turkey leg and chicken breast.

                        <a href="#">Nutriwoof&apos;s Superfood Supplement</a> is also a great source of zinc. Zinc is
                        important for
                        immunity, wound healing
                        and skin and coat health. While oysters are a great source of zinc, other sources include beef,
                        beef liver, lamb, turkey
                        thigh, and chicken thigh. Zinc can also be supplemented through pumpkin and sunflower seeds.
                        These are generally
                        needed in very small amounts daily

                        <a href="#">Goat Milk Powder by Magic Paws</a> and <a href="#">Green Tripe by Nutriwoof</a>
                        contain Probiotics and Digestive
                        Enzymes.
                        Supplementing your dog&apos;s diet with probiotics helps build good gut bacteria, and reduces the
                        incidence of digestive
                        upset and allergies. A healthy gut translates into good immunity for humans and their dogs
                        alike. Other sources of
                        the same include curd and kefir. We recommend that you start slow when introducing these
                        ingredients for the first
                        time to ensure these are tolerated well by your pet.

                    Our recommendations are based on general supplementation required through whole food sources for
                    dogs on a home-cooked diet. Every dog is an individual and recipes may differ. If in doubt do
                    consult a certified pet
                    nutritionist or veterinarian to ensure you are dosing everything correctly and to avoid
                    over-supplementation which in
                    some cases can have detrimental effects on your pet.
