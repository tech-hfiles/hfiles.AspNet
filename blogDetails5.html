                <h1>The burden of expectations & its impact on young minds</h1>
                <h5>Published on: Aug 8, 2023 | Readtime: 5 min</h5>

                <p>
                    Christopher was a bright young boy who excelled in sports but lagged a little in academics. His parents were indifferent toward his sports performance but would constantly pressure him to improve his academic performance. Although he wasn't bad at academics, he was not the best in his class. After every long and tiring day, when Christopher came home, his parents would nag him about his studies. Eventually, Christopher lost interest in sports, became disengaged in class, and gradually slipped further in academics as well. This is a classic example of how parental expectations can sometimes do more harm than good. Today, we will discuss the burden and impact of parental expectations on young minds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the outset, let me make it clear that I am not suggesting parents should have no expectations for their children at all. However, I am asking parents to reflect on whether their expectations are truly reasonable and whether it is right to impose them on their children. Parental expectations can help nurture a child's self-esteem and encourage healthy development; however, when these expectations are set unrealistically high or very low, they can affect a child's personality and sense of worth. Therefore, it is important to strike a balance to promote healthy development in children.
                </p>
                <h2>What's wrong with unrealistic expectations? Everything.</h2>
                <p>Some negative consequences of unrealistic expectations include:</p>
                <ol type="I">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Preconceived Expectations:</strong> Many of us have expectations for our children even before they are born—which is not inherently bad—but these dreams and expectations can weigh heavily on a child, especially if they are communicated frequently. For example, telling a child, "I always wanted you to do this and that, even before you were born," can be problematic.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Loss of Interest:</strong> If parents do not appreciate their child's strengths or always set unrealistic goals, the child may eventually lose interest in their activities. Conversely, setting very low expectations or conveying that no expectations exist can suggest that the child is not valued.
                        Both excessively high and low expectations can drastically affect a child's self-esteem.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Increased Anxiety:</strong> Research suggests that children whose parents impose unrealistic expectations are more prone to failure, anxiety, and discouragement, especially when they cannot meet those expectations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Perception of Skills and Abilities:</strong> Parental expectations can influence how children perceive their skills and abilities. For instance, in one case I worked with, a girl was always told by her parents that she was "mean" toward her siblings. Therapy revealed that she actually cared deeply for her younger siblings but had limited interactions with them because her parents would criticize her whenever something went wrong between the siblings.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Differentiated Expectations:</strong> If parents set different expectations for two children, the outcomes will often reflect those expectations. Research suggests that if parents expect one child to perform better than the other academically or in other areas, that is typically what will happen (Journal of Family Psychology).
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    There are various reasons why some parents set unrealistic expectations. These might stem from their own experiences, unaddressed personal expectations, or comparisons with other children. If you, as a parent, have set unhealthy expectations for your child, take a moment to reflect on what might be driving this behavior.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, setting realistic expectations—ones that are neither too low nor too high—helps children develop competence and a sense of self-worth. Realistic expectations also involve accepting children's mistakes without being overly critical. Here are some tips for setting realistic expectations:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Understand Your Child's Strengths and Weaknesses:</strong> Having expectations in areas where your child excels helps them succeed and keeps your expectations realistic. For example, Christopher's parents could have set higher expectations for him in sports, where his strengths lay, instead of focusing solely on academics.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Age-Appropriate Expectations:</strong> Parental rules and expectations should be age-appropriate and consider the child's maturity level and skills.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Discuss the Purpose:</strong> Before communicating your expectations, discuss with your children the purpose and meaning of achieving certain goals. This provides them with a valid reason for meeting your expectations.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Remember, even when your teen is rolling their eyes at you, they are listening to what you say. Your comments and expectations as a parent carry more weight in your child's life than you might realize.
